# Variables
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory. 
# Variables are used to store data, and the data can be of any data type, such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, or other objects. 
# Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning they don't require a specific data type to be declared before they are used. 
# When a value is assigned to a variable, Python automatically detects the data type of the value and assigns it to the variable. 
# Variables in Python can be created by assigning a value to a name using the equal sign (=). 
# Once a variable is created, its value can be updated or modified as needed. 
# Variables are used extensively in Python programming to store and manipulate data.

# Creating a Variable
# variableName = value
myVariable = 10 # notice in python we do not use semicolons to end a line of code

# Updating a Variable
# Variables can be updated by assigning a new value to the variable
myVariable = 20
myVariable = "Hello World!" # in python we can change the data type of a variable
