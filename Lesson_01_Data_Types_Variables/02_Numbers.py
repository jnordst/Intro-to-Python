# Numbers
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In python there are two main types of numbers: integers and floats
# Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.
# Floats are numbers with decimal values, such as 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, etc.

#----------------------------------------------------
# Integers
#----------------------------------------------------
# Integers are a data type used to represent whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any fractional or decimal components. 
# Integers are a built-in data type in Python and are represented by the "int" keyword. 
# Integers can be used in mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
# Python supports arbitrary precision integers, meaning integers can be of any size and are not limited by the number of bits used to represent them.

# Creating a new variable of type integer
myInt = 5 # whole numbers
myInt = -5 # can be positive or negative

# Integers can be used in mathematical operations
myInt = 5 + -5 # myInt becomes the value 0

#----------------------------------------------------
# Floats
#----------------------------------------------------
# Floats are a data type used to represent numbers with fractional or decimal components. 
# Floats are a built-in data type in Python and are represented by the "float" keyword. 
# Floats can be used in mathematical operations just like integers. 
# However, because floats represent numbers with finite precision, they may not always be accurate in representing decimal numbers.

myFloat = 13.2 # numbers with a decimal point
myFloat = -13.2 # can be positive or negative
myFlaot = 100 / 3 # 33.3333333...
