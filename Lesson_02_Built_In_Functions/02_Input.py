# The input() function is used to get input from the user via the console. 
# The input() function prompts the user with a message, waits for the user to type something in, and then returns the input as a string. 

# Ask the user for their name
myInput = input("What is your Name?")

# Here, the prompt message is the message that will be displayed to the user. 
# The input() function will wait for the user to type something in and press Enter. 
# Once the user enters some text, the input is returned as a string and assigned to the variable myInput
